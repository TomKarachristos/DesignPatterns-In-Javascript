#### Files:

+ jqueryCode.js: See how the jquery use internal the composite pattern  when you use the addClass function 

#### Some notes:
+ A composite should have a HAS-A relationship with its children, not an IS-A relationship
+ Usuay a composite use a tree like data structures for the implementation
+ Composite can be very helpfull in javascirpt, you can threts to a collection of dom in the same way!
+ You should only use the composite pattern when you have both of the following: (1)Groups of objects, in some sort of hierarchy (the exact structure of which could be unknown at development time) (2)An operation you want to perform on those objects, or on some subset of them
