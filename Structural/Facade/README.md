#### Some notes:
+ Facade make worse the performance
+ The facade pattern does two things: it simplifies the interface of a class, and it decouples that
class from the client code that uses it.
+ Facades are the core principle behind nearly all JavaScript libraries.
+ Facade objects are often Singleton because only one Facade object is required.
+ A facade is not used to allow interaction with clients that require a particular interface; it is used to provide a simpler interface.
