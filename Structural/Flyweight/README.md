##### Flyweight pattern: a large quantity of objects share a common properties object to save space.

#### Files:
+ flyweight.js: Here you can see a code that don't use flyweight and the way will be if will be using.
+ flyweight2.js: A more advance example.
+ jquerySingleCode.js: A use of flyweight inside the jquery code.

#### Some notes:
+ A flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory. Often some parts of the object state can be shared, and it is common practice to hold them in external data structures and pass them to the flyweight objects temporarily when they are used. optimization does come at a price in complexity.
