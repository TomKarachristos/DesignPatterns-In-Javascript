##### Module pattern is a design pattern used to implement the concept of software modules, defined by modular programming, in a programming language with incomplete direct support for the concept.

#### Files:
+ module.js: Two examples. A simple one, and one that can split the module in many files
+ revealingModule.js: An improvment of the reqular design pattern from Christian Heilmannâ€™s.

#### Some notes:
+ Used from many libraries in javascript, and realy is one way to go if you use pure javascript for develop.
+ module many often will be a singleton.
