##### Factory method pattern which allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses.

+ simpleFactory.js: Two simple examples of factory pattern, the second  a little more complicate that the one.
+ factoryMethod.js: A nice full factory examples, more close to implemetations in others programming languages.
+ abstractFactory.js: Two examples of Abstract factory pattern. The second use the dynamic typing to make a vary nice way to make a Abstract factory who register new "factories".
