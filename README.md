# Design patterns in javascripts

Here you will find many examples for each pattern in javascript ES5, with primary goal the understanding of design patterns and the clean code.

It was difficult for me to understand all the difference between each pattern. So here I organize all the pattern with many examples that give you(me) a better understanding. I first make some simple examples, later some more advance and add real examples codes from famous libraries like the jquery. I add some theory and rules of thumb too.

I use javascript not by random, but because it simplify many design patterns in a way the structure and intents is reveal more easy. I have used code from many places, and have modified it, so to be more simple and have added many comments too.
