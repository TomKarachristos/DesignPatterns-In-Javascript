- The Factory pattern can be especially useful when applied to the following situations:
	- When our object or component setup involves a high level of complexity
	- When we need to easily generate different instances of objects depending on the environment we are in
	- When we're working with many small objects or components that share the same properties
	- When composing objects with instances of other objects that need only satisfy an API contract (aka, duck typing) to work. This is useful for decoupling.
