##### Template method pattern , Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. TemplateMethod lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

#### Rules Of Thumb:
+ Template method uses inheritance to vary part of an algorithm. Strategy uses delegation to vary the entire algorithm.
+ Strategy is like Template method except in its granularity.
+ Template method uses inheritance to vary part of an algorithm. Strategy uses delegation to vary the entire algorithm.
