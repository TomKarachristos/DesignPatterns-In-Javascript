##### State pattern, a clean way for an object to partially change its type at runtime.

This pattern is used to encapsulate varying behavior for the same object based on its internal state. This can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to large monolithic conditional statements[1]:395 and thus improve maintainability

#### Rules Of Thumb:
+ Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
+ State objects are often Singletons.
+ State is like Strategy except in its intent.
